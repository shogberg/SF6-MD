5HP offensive stuff
- 5HP <nothing>
  - watch opponents reaction
- 5HP 5HP
  - Frame traps
- 5HP xx L.SpinKnuckle
  - Safe on block (but -) and frame traps but loses to OD DP
- 5HP xx H.SpinKnuckle
  - Can be interrupted by jab or OD DP, but lets you steal a turn
- 5HP xx H.Hooligan 
  - hooligan throw is a great response when people are conditioned to parry L.SpinKnuckle
  - overhead is good if people are blocking and not mashing.  This also blows people up for trying to do 2MK after your block string
- 5HP xx DI
- 5HP xx DR 5MP 50/50
  - 5HP xx DR 5MP 5MP frame traps 
  - 5HP xx DR 5MP Throw
  - 5HP xx DR 5MP (confirm) 2MP xx H.Spiral Arrow (or combo ender of your choice)
- 5HP xx DR 2LK
  - 5HP xx DR 2LK, 2|5LP block string
  - Reset | DP bait: 5HP xx DR 2LK, 2LP, xx L.Hooligan
    - This will make a mashed OD DP miss, will also side swap (no input for slide low, LK for divekick)
  - 5HP xx DR 2LK, 2LP, 2LP xx M.Spiral Arrow
    - confirm.  Can end with SA3 (3391 dmg non CA)
- 5HP xx DR 5LP
  - 5HP xx DR 5LP, 5LK frametraps, can confirm into M.SpiralArrow or other combo ender5
  - 5HP xx DR 5LP, throw
- 5HP xx DR 2HP
  - 5HP xx DR 2HP, 5LP is safe true blockstring
  - 5HP xx DR 2HP,throw requires a microwalk forward, and can be dp'd but not jabbed
  - 5HP xx DR 2HP 5HP <combo ender \ cash out \ whatever)

5MK \ 5HK 
- Use 5MK to control space, learn the distance real well.  Minus on block, but safe if spaced.  Can often do 5MK, 5HK to catch people walking forward after they block 5MK.  5MK, 5HP will space trap people mashing
- Use 5HK to sit comfortably at range and whiff punish.  You don't get much damage conversion, but it knocks people to the corner
