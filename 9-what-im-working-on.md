**Neutral stuff vs shotos**
- jab > crmk > crmp > jab
  * think this is generally how we wanna play neutral vs Ken\Ryu and maybe Luke too.  Divekick kinda sucks vs sthp from ken\ryu, so play around it
 - more CH Jab 2MP stuff this is key vs better players
 - Need to find more spots to land a safe jump and cycle through different oki options to keep people on their toes more
  * Safe jump, launcher into dive kick into meaty divekick, launcher into hooligan overhead, medium spiral arrow H.SpinKnuckle etc

**Meaty Driverush OD Spin Knuckle**
- this seems to lose to throw, but beats a lot of wake up supers, may be a situational option
  * works well vs projectile supers since its proj invul.  Might be pretty niche circumstances to use but worth exploring more when bored

**focus on**
- fishing for CH jab in neutral and confirm to 2MP 
- AA consistently
- Don't overextend on offense

**DP Bait vs overeager mashers**
  -2LK 5LP xx L.Hooligan baits an OD reversal and is safe vs atleast DP's (not sure if other angles will hit)
