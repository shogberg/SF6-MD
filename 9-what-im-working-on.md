**DP Punish**
- Meterless in corner 2HP, 4HK, M.SpiralArrow, H.CannonSpike
- Safejump 2HP, 4HK, M.SpiralArrow, Jump.HP

**Time to learn Ken's BS**
- Perfect parry \ DI \ DP timing for Dragonlash?
- What to do against Jinrai?  OD DP?
- What other characters have neutral skips that I don't check and let get them inside for free?

**Slow down the game**
- look for situations where I'm playing to the opponents speed instead of playing slow and methodically
- it's ok to play fast to overwhelm someone, but this should be a choice, not the default speed

**drills**
- drill throw oki xx DP | crosscut DP
- think we can OS H.DP and 4HK in crosscut situations in the corner by holding the final 6 in the DP motion.  H.DP should come out for neutral jump, 4HK (which we'll take into a side swap hooligan) if they jump over

**Neutral stuff vs shotos**
- jab > crmk > crmp > jab
  * think this is generally how we wanna play neutral vs Ken\Ryu and maybe Luke too.  Divekick kinda sucks vs sthp from ken\ryu, so play around it
 - more CH Jab 2MP stuff this is key vs better players
 - Need to find more spots to land a safe jump and cycle through different oki options to keep people on their toes more
  * Safe jump, launcher into dive kick into meaty divekick, launcher into hooligan overhead, medium spiral arrow H.SpinKnuckle etc

#4/27/24

**Meaty Driverush OD Spin Knuckle**
- this seems to lose to throw, but beats a lot of wake up supers, may be a situational option
  * works well vs projectile supers since its proj invul.  Might be pretty niche circumstances to use but worth exploring more when bored

**focus on**
- fishing for CH jab in neutral and confirm to 2MP 
- AA consistently
- Don't overextend on offense

**DP Bait vs overeager mashers**
  -2LK 5LP xx L.Hooligan baits an OD reversal and is safe vs atleast DP's (not sure if other angles will hit)

#4/24/24

**Meaty Spin Knuckle Set ups**
- Charged Hooligan (or ex hooligan) throw xx M.Spiral Arrow, FRAMEKILL 5LP, H.Spin Knuckle
- 5LP, 5LP, 5LK xx M.Spiral Arrow, H.SpinKnuckle
- You can Frametrap 4MP ~~ 4HK after H.SpinKnuckle in these set ups, or whiff jab and l.hooligan to bait OD DP
