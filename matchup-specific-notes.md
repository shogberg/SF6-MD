#Blanka
- Can punish a blocked H.Ball with SA3 as long as you're not burned out

#Dhalsim
- Hooligan Slide hits low, won't get hit by SA2.  Good for oki in "obvious" reversal situations.  Try 4MP~~4HK xx Charged H.Hooligan slide.

#JP
- Amnesia response in corner: 4MP~~4HK xx DI (DR 4HK, DR 5HP xx DR 5HP xx Charged H.CannonSpike xx SA3)
- Regular Spikes, Fireballs and Portals are reactable with SA3.  Depending on spacing, fake fireball can be caught too.  Especially helpful when JP is full screen trying to hit you with oki
