**Confirms**
- 2MK|2MP|2HP xx DR 2HP, 5HP xx M.SpiralArrow (M.CannonSpike more damage, less oki|carry)
	* if you're drive rushing off a blocked button go into jabs to pressure, 5HP is worth messing with too but is less safe
- jab, jab, jab xx M.SpiralArrow (M.CannonSpike more damage, less oki|carry)
	* 5LP and 2LP are interchangeable.  5LK is also cancelable and has a bit more range but does not chain into another jab.  2LK chains into either light punch for mixing up block strings

	* 5LP\2LP is always interchangeable, 2LK chains into 5LP\2LP but does not cancel into specials, 5LK has more range and is a good cancelable end of a string if you don't think other light buttons will hit
- In the corner, you can use 2MP, 5MP xx H.Spiral Arrow (better oki) or H.Cannon Spike (better damage)
