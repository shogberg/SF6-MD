**5MK \ 5HK**
- Use 5MK to control space, learn the distance real well.  Minus on block, but safe if spaced.  Can often do 5MK, 5HK to catch people walking forward after they block 5MK.  5MK, 5HP will space trap people mashing
- Use 5HK to sit comfortably at range and whiff punish.  You don't get much damage conversion, but it knocks people to the corner

**Divekick Concepts**
- Divekicks as gap closer
  * Know the distance of each of your divekick options, as you really want to aim for the opponents toes.  As a rule of thumb for (near) instant divekicks, OD|Heavy Divekick is just longer than 5HK range, Medium Divekick is approximately 5MK range, and Light Divekick is approximately 5LK range.
  * Aiming at the toes with a flat angle (so usually H|M.Divekick) really blows up (vertical) button AA's, or things like Gief's Lariat since you can come in "under" the AA hitbox
  * You can work on a few jump spacing concepts to mess with opponents reactions:
    - A mix of jump in HK, H.Divekick and L.Divekick from distance can really add mental stack to an opponent's AAs
      * use L.Divekick to bait DPs for a punish
    - Similarly, cross up LK jump in and L.Divekick can be ambiguous from in close.
    - HP jump in and M.Divekick should work pretty well together as well.
    - Empty jump throw is good if opponent is responding to jump ins with parry attempts
    - L.Divekick from any distance can be good to bait AA\DP response, but the actual distance you want to do it from can vary depending on the opponent.  This can be really effective against modern players or other players that are AA'ing the vast majority of jump in attempts
- Divekicks can also be used effectively as a quasi-frame trap or anti-poke.
  * If you get a feel for the rhythm of an opponent throwing buttons out in neutral (especially long lingering buttons) you can walk up divekick at the range your opponent is throwing from.  This really opens up the ground for you as they'll be scared of hitting buttons to catch you walking in.  
  * Similarly L.Divekick up close works very similar to a frame trap.  Follow up a block string with L.Divekick to catch an opponent pressing. This is very effective if they like to throw out things like 2MK after your block string
  * I find I implement both of these types of divekicks mostly on 'feel', but if you want to do it based more on 'thought', try to look for spots where your opponent likes to take their turn back when you're spaced about jab\5LK away from the opponent and try throwing out a L.Divekick

**5HP offensive stuff**
- 5HP <nothing>
  - watch opponents reaction
- 5HP 5HP
  - Frame traps
- 5HP xx L.SpinKnuckle
  - Safe on block (but -) and frame traps but loses to OD DP
- 5HP xx H.SpinKnuckle
  - Can be interrupted by jab or OD DP, but lets you steal a turn
- 5HP xx H.Hooligan 
  - hooligan throw is a great response when people are conditioned to parry L.SpinKnuckle
  - overhead is good if people are blocking and not mashing.  This also blows people up for trying to do 2MK after your block string
- 5HP xx DI
- 5HP xx DR 5MP 50/50
  - 5HP xx DR 5MP 5MP frame traps 
  - 5HP xx DR 5MP Throw
  - 5HP xx DR 5MP (confirm) 2MP xx H.Spiral Arrow (or combo ender of your choice)
- 5HP xx DR 2LK
  - 5HP xx DR 2LK, 2|5LP block string
  - Sideswitch\Crossup Reset | DP bait: 5HP xx DR 2LK, 2LP, xx L.Hooligan
    - This will make a mashed OD DP miss, will also side swap (no input for slide low, LK for divekick)
  - 5HP xx DR 2LK, 2LP, 2LP xx M.Spiral Arrow
    - confirm.  Can end with SA3 (3391 dmg non CA)
- 5HP xx DR 5LP
  - 5HP xx DR 5LP, 5LK frametraps, can confirm into M.SpiralArrow or other combo ender5
  - 5HP xx DR 5LP, throw
- 5HP xx DR 2HP
  - 5HP xx DR 2HP, 5LP is safe true blockstring
  - 5HP xx DR 2HP,throw requires a microwalk forward, and can be dp'd but not jabbed
  - 5HP xx DR 2HP 5HP <combo ender \ cash out \ whatever)
